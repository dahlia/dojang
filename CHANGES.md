Dojang changelog
=================

Version 0.2.0
-------------

To be released.

 -  The `dojang init` command now generates *.gitignore* if the source directory
    is a Git repository and the file does not exist yet.  [#16]
 -  Fixed a bug that Dojang had not recognized `kernel.release` field in
    a *dojang-env.toml* file unlike how it was documented and how `dojang env`
    command have behaved.  [#17]
