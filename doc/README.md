Dojang, a cross-platform dotfiles manager
=========================================

**Dojang** is a cross-platform dotfiles manager.  Here are some of
the highlights:

 -  Lightweight.  It's built as a native executable, so it's easy to install
    and fast to run.
 -  Cross-platform.  It works on both the POSIX family and Windows.
 -  Flexible.  It keeps in mind that config files can be placed in different
    places or have different contents depending on the environment.
 -  Safe.  Every run can be previewed by simulating it in a sandbox environment
    with the `--dry-run` option.
 -  Friendly.  Error messages are friendly and print helpful hints or warnings.
