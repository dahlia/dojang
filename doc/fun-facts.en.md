Naming and etymology
--------------------

Dojang is named after the Korean word [圖章] (dojang), which means stamp or
seal, because it copies dotfiles to multiple devices just like a stamp.
Dojang has the same first two characters as dotfiles, but that's a pure
coincidence.

There's also a homophone, [道場] (dojang), which refers to a martial arts [dojo]
or temple hall, and is a cognate of the Japanese word [道場][dōjō] (dōjō).
Anyway, it's not any relevant to this project.
